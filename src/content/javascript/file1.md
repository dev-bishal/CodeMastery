JavaScript's find() Method

The find() method in JavaScript is used to return the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

Syntax

array.find(callbackFn, thisArg)
Copy
callbackFn: A function to execute for each element in the array. It should return a truthy value to indicate a matching element has been found, and a falsy value otherwise.

thisArg: Optional. A value to use as this when executing callbackFn.
